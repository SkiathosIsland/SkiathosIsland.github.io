          <h2>
            Skiathos Travellers started in 2021 when we saw from many travelers
            coming to the Sporades have a big gap in information about the daily
            cruises, the routes they make, and the options they have where to
            have a nice dinner and what vehicle to rent. Through a quick search
            and many discussions with travelers and service providers, we
            realized how difficult it is for tourists to find and book things
            they can do at their destination, as well as find out where to go
            and what places to visit. So we designed a booking system for daily
            cruises and boat rentals and various service offerings that were
            targeted at travelers. Our goal is to serve all these needs because
            our activity in the market has allowed us to come close to these
            people and help them so that they can make a daily cruise to
            Sporades unforgettable and with many experiences. Here you can find
            all the information about the beaches, the sights, the activities
            and the daily cruises for the island.
